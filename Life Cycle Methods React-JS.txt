|***** React-JS Life Cycle Events *****|

Note: The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

| "MOUNTING" |
React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

1: constructor()
Note: The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and 
other initial values. The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else.

2: getDerivedStateFromProps()
Note: The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.

3: render()
Note: The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

4: componentDidMount()
Note: This method runs when the component rendered successfully.


| "UPDATING" |
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.
A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

1: getDerivedStateFromProps()
Note: It is same as previous. But anything will not update after this.

2: shouldComponentUpdate()
Note: In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
The default value is true. If you give the value to false then it will not update anything but it will if you give value to true.

3: render()
Note: It is same as previous.

4: getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
Note: This method will tell you what was the previous state and previous props after the updating.

5: componentDidUpdate()
Note: The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.
It can tell you the updates in the DOM.


| "UNMOUNTING" |
1: componentWillUnmount()
Note: The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
